# RSA Cryptosystem in Python

This repository provides a simple yet educational implementation of the **RSA algorithm** in Python.  
It demonstrates how public and private keys are generated, and how messages can be securely encrypted and decrypted.

## Features
- 🔑 Key generation with customizable key size
- ✉️ Message encryption & decryption
- 🧮 Prime number generation using the Rabin-Miller primality test
- 📂 Save & load keys from files

## Modules
- **file1 (KeyGenerator)**: Main script for generating keys, encrypting, and decrypting messages
- **file2 (Math)**: Prime number generation & primality testing
- **file3 (PrimeNumber)**: Mathematical helper functions (GCD, modular inverse)

## Usage
1. Run the program.
2. Choose between generating new keys or encrypting/decrypting a message.
3. Follow the prompts to save keys and messages.
